= Navi =

This is a program to quickly create and edit notes.

Navi is being made with the following goals in mind:

- Easy access from anywhere with a global hotkey
  - Easy on Windows, not sure how it will be on Linux
- Notes can be created by only providing a name; they are saved in the same
  location (%APPDATA%/Navi, ~/.Navi)
- Notes are opened in tabs
- Notes are automatically saved when hiding/closing the program

I'm developing this mainly to myself, but suggestions are welcome.


= How to use =

Run it. To hide it, press Esc. To open it again, click the notification icon
or press the hotkey (you'll need to set one in the options).

Everything else should be self-explanatory, but don't hesitate to ask
for help.
